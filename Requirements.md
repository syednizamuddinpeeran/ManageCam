# ManageCam

## Project Requirements Markup (Generalized Camera Support)

### Project Overview

- Create a Python application (Dockerized) that interfaces with any network camera accessible via IP/web API or streaming protocols.
- The app will connect to the cameraâ€™s API or stream URL to fetch images and/or video, offering processing and monitoring.
- Integrate a Telegram bot for remote notifications and image/video sharing.

### Functional Requirements

- Connect to any IP camera via configurable HTTP API endpoints or RTSP stream URLs.
- Fetch still images or capture frames from video streams.
- Display, save, or process retrieved images/videos as needed.
- Handle failures, retries, and recovery gracefully.
- Send images or notifications to a Telegram bot based on trigger events or commands.
- Receive and process commands from Telegram to control fetching or query camera status.

### Technical Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Use flexible HTTP client libraries (`requests`, etc.) for API calls and `OpenCV` or similar for RTSP stream capture.
- Use `python-telegram-bot` or equivalent for Telegram integration.
- Docker containerization for consistent cross-platform operation.
- Configuration support for camera IP, API endpoints, stream URLs, fetch intervals.
- Configurable Telegram bot credentials and targets.
- Logging, error handling, and modular design for easy extension.

### Camera Details

- Support for multiple camera types with configurable endpoints or stream URLs.
- Support REST APIs providing single image captures or video streaming (RTSP/HTTP).
- Local network access assumed, with possibility for VLAN or remote IP configurations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Simple, clear, and easily modifiable configuration interface.
- Modular architecture to add new camera types or protocols.
- Reliable operation with secure handling of network credentials and API tokens.

### Future Updates

- Support for AI-based image/video processing.
- User-friendly dashboard or web interface.
- Enhanced notification features (motion detection, alerts).
- Expanded Telegram bot command set.
